# AlbionSoloScorecard

The Albion Online Solo Player Scorecard is an unofficial way for solo players to track their progress during their daily gameplay.  The thought behind it is that solo players often times feel like they are not making progress because they tend to focus on the more negative experience of getting ganked rather than focusing on what they were able to accomplish before that point.  To combat this, Blackboa and his stream community came up with a number of key performance indicators (KPI) for solo players to give themselves credit for.

This project is personally inspired by <a id="blackboatwitch" href="https://www.twitch.tv/blackboa" target="_blank">Blackboa</a>

I am new to coding and found this to be a great first project.

Currently this webapp has full functionality and could be used by the community, however, it doesn't look pretty. That will come later.

**To try it out, download the ZIP at the green Code button, then open index.html**

Some features I may get around to..
1.  Make it look good. 
2.  Make it more Mobile friendly
3.  Make a reset button, which will help with the next goal
4.  Create personal best tracking
5.  Create personal historical stats

Thank you for checking this out!
